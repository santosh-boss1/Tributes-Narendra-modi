                        ☛Narendra Damodardas Modi (Gujarati: 
                        [ˈnəɾendɾə dɑmodəɾˈdɑs ˈmodiː] ( listen);
                         born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician

                        ☛ Our Mantra should be: ‘Beta Beti, Ek Samaan’
                         "Let us celebrate the birth of the girl child.
                          We should be equally proud of our daughters.
                           I urge you to sow five plants when your daughter is
                            born to celebrate the occasion." -PM Narendra Modi to
                             citizens of his adopted village Jayapur. Beti Bachao Beti
                              Padhao (BBBP) was launched by the Prime Minister on
                               22nd January, 2015 at Panipat, Haryana. BBBP addresses
                                the declining Child Sex Ratio (CSR) and related issues

                                    initiatives to come. For me, JAM is about Just 
                                     Maximum. Maximum value for every rupee spent. Maximum 
                                      for our poor. Maximum technology penetration among
                                       the masses. -Narendra Modi 67 years after Independence,
                                        India still had a large part of the population who had
                                         no access to banking services. This meant, they had
                                          neither any avenues for Savings, nor any opportunity
                                           to get institutional credit. PM Modi launched the Pradhan
                                            Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana on 28th August to address this
                                             fundamental issue. Within a matter of months, this scheme

                                              ☛  I strongly believe that India has a lot of latent
                                               entrepreneurial energy, which needs to be harnessed so
                                                that we become a nation of job givers, more than job seekers.

                                                  a boost to entrepreneurship. The ‘Make in India’ initiative
                                                   is based on four pillars to boost entrepreneurship in India,
                                                    not only in manufacturing but also in other sectors. New

                                                      business’ as the single most important factor to promote
